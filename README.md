# stock-api
This uses the yahoo finance api to recreate the iphone stock app with charts

N/B: The stock prices might not be up to date since it is loaded from a text file on the server to increase load speed. you can decide to get the data direct, but the process is usually slow so i suggest you retrieve them in the background by hitting this endpoint "/path/to/your/app/get-api.php"

The graphs were plotted using the google charts api, while the data is gotten from yahoo finance "https://query1.finance.yahoo.com"
Enjoy
